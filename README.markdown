# GitHub Dark [![tags](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark/tags) [![star this repo](http://github-svg-buttons.herokuapp.com/star.svg?user=StylishThemes&repo=GitHub-Dark&style=flat&background=1081C1)](http://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark) [![fork this repo](http://github-svg-buttons.herokuapp.com/fork.svg?user=StylishThemes&repo=GitHub-Dark&style=flat&background=1081C1)](http://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark/fork)

- Install from [userstyles.org](http://userstyles.org/styles/37035) (with customization options) or [manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark/master/github-dark.css).
- Stylish is available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylish-for-opera/) and [Firefox Mobile](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108/).
- **NOTE**: Not all themes are available, once we figure out how to convert the old pygments themes to the new layout you will see the updates in [this demo](http://StylishThemes.github.io/GitHub-Dark/) to visualize the available code color schemes.
- Use a [grunt build process](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark/wiki/Build) to customize your GitHub Dark theme.
