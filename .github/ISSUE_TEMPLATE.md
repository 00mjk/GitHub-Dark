### Unstyled Content

- [ ] The issue only occurs when the GitHub-Dark style is enabled.
- [ ] I am using the most up-to-date GitHub-Dark style!

  <!-- HOW TO UPDATE:
  Make sure to first update DIRECTLY from https://userstyles.org/styles/37035/
  (see https://github.com/JasonBarnabe/stylish-chrome/issues/179 to know why)

  or, if using the GitHub-Dark script, use the "Force Update Style" button, then
  force refresh the web page (Windows: Ctrl+F5; Mac/Apple: Apple+R or Command+R;
  Linux: F5)

  <!-- OS/BROWSER COMBINATIONS:
  An extensive list is not necessary if the issue occurs in all browsers; this
  is important if the problem only occurs in a specific OS/browser combination
  -->

- [ ] Please provide the URL of the unstyled content, if not obvious.
- [ ] If unable to provide a URL, please report the class name of unstyled content.

  <!-- FINDING THE CLASS NAME:
  Right click on top of the element to open the context menu, and choose
  "Inspect". This will open the developer tools panel. A screenshot of both the
  unstyled element, and the development tools panel showing the element and the
  styles/rule frame on the right would be the easiest to provide.
